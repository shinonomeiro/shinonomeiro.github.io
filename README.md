https://shinonomeiro.github.io/jautocomplete/<br/>
Running demo of <a href="https://github.com/shinonomeiro/Jautocomplete">Jautocomplete</a> with 5000 Japanese train station names from あ to た (total of 10,000 if counting transforms as well) + 2500 random a-z English words dataset.

https://shinonomeiro.github.io/actionpuzzle/<br/>
Running demo of <a href="https://github.com/shinonomeiro/CCPuzzle">CCPuzzle</a>. Fast-paced action puzzle game made with Cocos-2D-JS. Tap any tile in the grid to swap it with your current tile (shown below the yellow 'fever' bar) and perform match-three combos. Any time the scanbar hovers a 'counter' (or 'enemy') tile, its displayed number drops by one. Once it reaches zero, your will take damage to your HP. The only way to get rid of those is to have a nearby bomb explode. Have fun!

https://shinonomeiro.github.io/reactwebchat/<br/>
Simple <a href="https://github.com/shinonomeiro/ReactWebChat">chat interface</a> powered by React.js and dummy data. No server-side involved. This is an old project and does not reflect current design patterns and best practices.
