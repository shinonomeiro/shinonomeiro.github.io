## [CCPuzzle](https://shinonomeiro.github.io/actionpuzzle/) - Dec 2016

Running demo of [CCPuzzle](https://github.com/shinonomeiro/CCPuzzle). Fast-paced action puzzle game made with Cocos-2D-JS. Tap any tile in the grid to swap it with your current tile (shown below the yellow 'fever' bar) and perform match-three combos. Any time the scanbar hovers a 'counter' (or 'enemy') tile, its displayed number drops by one. Once it reaches zero, your will take damage to your HP. The only way to get rid of those is to have a nearby bomb explode. Have fun!
Implementation-wise, the code could certainly benefit from some modernization (i.e. ES6) backed with a more robust module bundler such as webpack. TODO.
